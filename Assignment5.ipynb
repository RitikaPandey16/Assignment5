    "Q15.How to install python on windows and set path variables?\n",
    "Ans.To install Python on Windows and set up the necessary environment variables, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Step 1: Download Python Installer\n",
    "        Go to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.\n",
    "        Download the latest version of Python for Windows (e.g., Python 3.x.x).\n",
    "        Make sure you download the installer that matches your system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).\n",
    "        Step 2: Run the Installer\n",
    "        Once the installer is downloaded, open it to start the installation process.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Important: On the first screen, check the box that says \"Add Python to PATH\". This will automatically set up the necessary environment variables for you.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Click \"Install Now\". This will install Python, along with pip (the package manager) and IDLE (the integrated development environment).\n",
    "        \n",
    "        If you missed checking the \"Add Python to PATH\" box, you can select \"Customize installation\" and ensure that the box is checked during the installation process.\n",
    "        Step 3: Set Environment Variables Manually (if needed)\n",
    "        If you didn't check the \"Add Python to PATH\" box during installation, you will need to set the environment variables manually:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Find the Python Installation Path:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Typically, Python will be installed in a folder like:\n",
    "        C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python3x\\\n",
    "        Set the PATH variable:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Right-click on the Start menu and select System.\n",
    "        Click on Advanced system settings on the left side.\n",
    "        In the System Properties window, click on the Environment Variables button.\n",
    "        Under the System variables section, find the Path variable, select it, and click Edit.\n",
    "        In the Edit Environment Variable window, click New, then paste the path to the Python installation directory (e.g., C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python3x\\).\n",
    "        Additionally, add the Scripts directory path, which is usually located in the same folder (e.g., C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python3x\\Scripts\\).\n",
    "        Confirm the Changes:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Click OK in all the open windows to save your changes.\n",
    "        Step 4: Verify the Installation\n",
    "        After setting the path, verify that Python is installed correctly:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Open Command Prompt (type cmd in the Start menu search and press Enter).\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Type the following command to check the Python version:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        bash\n",
    "        Copy code\n",
    "        python --version\n",
    "        You should see the Python version number printed (e.g., Python 3.x.x).\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Check if pip (Python package manager) is installed by typing:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        bash\n",
    "        Copy code\n",
    "        pip --version\n",
    "        This should return the version of pip if it’s installed correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Step 5: Testing Python\n",
    "        To ensure Python works properly, you can run the interactive Python shell:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        "
